            mentoring school children, working with the elderly, free health
            care, distributing winter care kits to the needy, to mention just a

            Main objective of initiating the child into a course of character
            building by developing self-discipline, providing healthy
            association, inculcating such habits of reading, listening,
            studying, and reciting, as it will sublimate the child&apos;s
            growing mind.

                must be generated among the youth. All my hopes are based on the
                students, the youth. They are very dear to me. The future of the
                world, good or bad depends on your conduct. The country will be
                safe, secure, peaceful and prosperous only when your conduct is
                good. What the world needs today is not affluence and material
                comforts, but men and women of noble character. The country is
                bound to disintegrate if the behaviour of the young men and
                women is not on the right lines.&quot;
