        <p>
          November 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On
          that day was born in the (then) obscure village of Puttaparthi, a
          charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family. None realised then, and
          indeed for a long time thereafter, that Divinity had incarnated in
          human form as Ratnakara Venkata Satyanarayana Raju, grandson of Mr.
          Kondama Raju, and son of Pedda Venkama Raju and Easwaramma.
          <br />
          <br />
          ​The birth of ordinary mortals is the direct consequence of earlier
          lives. The karma or the track-record of earlier births, i.e., the
          nature of deeds performed, both good and bad, determine the future
          janmas or births. In short, human birth is a karma janma (birth that
          is the consequence of earlier births). However, when the Lord comes
          down in human form, it is a different story altogether.
          <br />
          <br />
          He incarnates as a part of His unfathomable Cosmic Drama, to play as
          it were, a cameo role. He decides the time and the place of His
          incarnation, the parents, and also how His life would unfold. Thus,
          the Lord&apos;s birth as a human is a part of His Divine Sport or
          Leela; in other words, His life is a Leela Janma. In the Sathya Sai
          Incarnation, the Lord chose the Ratnakara family on account of the
          purity, piety, and the devotion of its members. Prior to the
          incarnation, Pedda Venkama Raju and Easwaramma had been blessed with
          one son and two daughters, Seshama Raju, Venkamma, and Parvathamma, in
          that order.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some years passed and Mother Easwaramma longed for another son. She
          observed all the prescribed austerities, and soon her prayers were
          answered - she was to become a mother again. Even before its birth,
          Easwaramma knew that the child to be born would be unusual. There was
          a definite reason for such a belief.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sometime prior to the birth of this new boy, Lakshmamma, the
          mother-in-law was engaged in the worship of Lord Sathyanarayana. The
          Lord then appeared in her dream and blessed her, indicating that He
          would be born in her family. Promptly, Lakshmamma alerted Easwaramma
          that the latter might have strange experiences, but ought not to worry
          about them. Shortly thereafter, Easwaramma had precisely one such
          experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          One day as she was drawing water from the well, Easwaramma was
          startled by the sight of a big blue ball of light. The ball came
          directly towards her and entered her; Easwaramma fainted and fell. The
          Lord had entered her womb for the mandatory stay prior to physical
          birth as Sathyanarayana Raju. Thus, the Lord was not begotten, but
          immaculately conceived, even as His Son (Jesus) had been, two thousand
          years ago.
          <br />

          One day as she was drawing water from the well, Easwaramma was
          startled by the sight of a big blue ball of light. The ball came
          directly towards her and entered her; Easwaramma fainted and fell. The
          Lord had entered her womb for the mandatory stay prior to physical

          immaculately conceived, even as His Son (Jesus) had been, two thousand
          years ago.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sathya was born in the early hours of November 23, 1926. There were
          any number of unusual incidents accompanying His birth, as also in His
          childhood (as in the case of Lord Krishna). Though they all gave
          strong hints of His Divinity, few realised until much later that
          Sathya was the Lord Himself. But all unfailingly recognised that
          Sathya was most unusual, extra-ordinarily intelligent, precocious, and
          above all, always full of Love and compassion.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Primary School, Sathya helped His classmates in diverse ways.
          Though from a poor family, He did not hesitate to give away His
          clothes to needy classmates. More importantly, He never lost an
          opportunity to turn the minds of His friends towards God. Among other
          things, He formed a bhajan group for this purpose, which later became
          very popular.
          <br />
          <br />
          It was time to move on to Higher Secondary School, but such a school
          was available only in Bukkapatnam, several kilometers to the north of
          Puttaparthi.Young Sathya now had to trudge back and forth every day,
          no matter what the weather, the muddy path through fields, walking on
          bunds, and wading through water, as required. In the Bukkapatnam
          School too, He was a model student, ever helpful to others.
          <br />
          <br />
          Making students God-conscious remained His prime occupation, and to
          hold the attention of His mates, He would often materialise prasadam
          (gift-articles or vibhuti), much to their amazement.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sathya was an automatic choice for the class-leader (monitor), but
          this brought its share of problems. Once, His teacher asked Sathya to
          slap all the boys in the class for an infringement of discipline.
          Instead of slapping hard as he was expected to, Sathya merely patted
          the cheeks of the errant pupils. This greatly angered the teacher, who
          then directed all his wrath on the class-leader. Sathya bore the
          punishment in stoic silence; for Him, it was all a part of the Drama
          scripted by Him, and this particular scene was being enacted to impart
          some lessons to humanity.
          <br />
          <br />
          On another occasion, the teacher handling a particular class-hour
          (period) noticed that Sathya was not writing down what was being
          dictated, while all other students did. When questioned, Sathya
          replied that He was not taking down because He already knew the
          lesson. Interpreting this response as gross impertinence, the teacher
          asked Sathya to stand up on the bench, a form of punishment popular in
          those days. Sathya obediently did.
          <br />
          <br />
          After a while the School bell rang, signalling the end of the period
          in progress, and the commencement of a new period. It was time for the
          teacher to leave the room and make way for another one who was to
          handle the next period. Mr. Mahboob Khan, this other teacher, entered
          the classroom and to his utter surprise saw Sathya standing upon the
          bench. Khan loved Sathya very much, and to him it was inconceivable
          that Sathya would have done anything to deserve a punishment. He also
          noticed that the teacher who had handled the previous period was not
          vacating the chair.
          <br />
          <br />
          To his astonishment he then discovered that this teacher was not
          getting up from the chair because he was stuck or glued to it -
          whenever the teacher tried to get up, the chair also lifted! In a
          flash, Khan understood the problem. He asked Sathya to get down from
          the bench and the stuck teacher promptly got his release! Years later
          Swami disclosed that this drama was staged not to inflict humiliation
          on the teacher concerned but to make people conscious of His Divine
          powers. Humiliation is something that does not exist in Swami&apos;s
          dictionary.
          <br />
          <br />
          Around this time, Mr. Seshama Raju, Sathya’s older brother, went to
          Kamalapuram to stay with his in-laws, and also qualify there as a
          teacher. Kamalapuram boasted of a good school and Seshama Raju thought
          that this was the school where Sathya ought to study - the entire
          family pinned its hope on Sathya, and dreamt that one day He would go
          to college and eventually end up as a big officer in the Government.
          And so, to Kamalpuram, Sathya went.
          <br />
          <br />
          Seshma Raju's in-laws, being relatively well heeled, looked down upon
          Sathya since He was quite poor. As a result, He was not only
          ill-treated but also called upon to perform arduous house-hold duties.
          He had, for example, to fetch drinking water everyday from a far-off
          well. Such chores left scars, which remain to this day.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the Kamalapuram School, Sathya was a great favourite of the Drill
          Master who doubled also as the Scout Master. Once, there was to be a
          grand General Fair and Cattle Show in the neighbouring village of
          Pushpagiri.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Scout Master wanted his troop to go Pushpagiri and render service
          of the type scouts were expected to. A subscription of ten rupees was
          collected from each boy for meeting the various expenses connected
          with the trip, including the bus fare.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not having the required amount, Sathya excused Himself from joining
          the group but assured the Scout Master that He would somehow or the
          other be in Pushpagiri at the appointed time for duty. While His
          friends went by bus, Sathya walked the entire distance, with little to
          eat on the way.
          <br />
          <br />
          When He finally reached Pushpagiri, He was very tired but did not
          flinch from discharging His duties. Just before returning, He
          thoughtfully bought a few small gifts for folks back home. When He
          returned, what greeted Him was not appreciation for the gifts but a
          severe punishment because His absence had created problems with the
          supply of drinking water.
          <br />
          <br />
          Much later, Swami revealed that He deliberately created such painful
          situations for Himself in order to teach the lesson of forbearance and
          equanimity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite the harsh treatment constantly administered, Swami has never
          ever criticised either His older brother or His sister-in-law,
          maintaining always that they were but mere instruments in His Drama,
          with specific roles to play.
          <br />
          <br />
          His teacher's training concluded, Seshama Raju moved from Kamalapuram
          to Uravakonda to take appointment as a Telugu teacher in a school
          there. Sathya went along and joined that school. Once again He
          excelled in everything, and became the cynosure of all eyes. But once
          He was back at home, it was the same painful routine; no let-up at
          all.
          <br />
          <br />
          And then, came the prophetic declaration...
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="post-cat sri-sathya-sai flex justify-center text-3xl p-20">
        <h2>The Defining Declaration</h2>
      </div>

      <div className="text-xl flex justify-center text-justify w-[60vw] m-auto p-10">
        <p>
          March 1940 marked a turning point. Sathya was allegedly stung one day
          by a scorpion, found in plenty in Uravakonda. His health became
          impaired and the village medics were consulted, but it did not help.
          Sathya&apos;s behaviour also appeared to undergo a change, and He
          became an enigma to all. Convinced that Sathya had come under the
          spell of evil spirits, all sorts of quack remedies were tried but they
          were of no avail.
          <br />
          <br />
          An exorciser was summoned but before he could get started, he heard a
          mysterious voice warning him; obeying the warning he promptly
          withdrew. Meanwhile, a frantic message was sent to Sathya's parents in
          Puttaparthi, and they both rushed to Uravakonda consumed with anxiety.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everyone was puzzled since Sathya was no longer the ideal and model
          school boy of the standard type. He was remote, withdrawn, and
          indifferent to worldly matters. If He spoke, which was rarely, it was
          always on spiritual matters.
          <br />
          <br />
          At times He would burst into non-stop recitation of Vedic hymns He had
          never learnt. On matters philosophical and spiritual, He dared even to
          correct elders, acknowledged experts and scholars – all this was
          something He was never known to do before.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sathya was then taken to other places like Bellary and Dharmavaram for
          treatment but there was no improvement. One more attempt was made and
          this time He was taken to an exorciser in Kadri, a mean and cruel
          person. Here, young Sathya was put through incredible physical
          torture, unimaginable even in the proverbial Hell. The witch-doctor
          was verily an agent of death, and when his atrocities mounted, Sathya
          was whisked away back to home in Puttaparthi.
          <br />
          <br />
          Days and weeks passed, and Sathya continued to be "abnormal". Came May
          23, 1940, and with it a revelation. That morning Sathya was in a good
          mood, materialising flowers and sugar candy in plenty, and
          distributing them to all those who called on Him. Father Venkama Raju
          heard about this but was neither pleased nor amused.
          <br />
          <br />
          Suspecting trickery, he armed himself with a big stick, approached
          Sathya, and asked, "Who are You? Are You God, ghost, or devil?" The
          big moment had arrived and Sathya calmly replied,
          <br />
          <br />
          "I am Sai."
          <br />
          <br />
          The stick slowly slipped out of Venkama Raju's hand but he still
          remained puzzled. And so he asked: "What are we to do with You?"
          Sathya replied,
          <br />
          <br />
          "Worship Me."
          <br />
          <br />
          The father's next question was, "When?" Came the answer,
          <br />
          <br />
          "Every Thursday."
          <br />
          <br />
          That was when the worship of Sathya Sai first commenced.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          One Thursday, someone challenged: "If You are Sai Baba, show us some
          proof." Sathya then asked for some flowers. A bunch of jasmine flowers
          were given to Him. He threw them on the floor; instead of falling
          randomly, they got neatly arranged to form the words “SAI BABA” in
          Telugu. Such revelations not withstanding, Sathya was forced to return
          to Uravakonda and resume school.
          <br />
          <br />
          Looking back, one can see that starting from the very beginning and
          particularly from March 1940, Sathya had been gradually setting the
          stage for what was soon to follow. Right from the time He was a little
          boy, He had, constantly and consistently, displayed the Divine
          qualities of compassion, sacrifice, forbearance, and selfless Love.
          <br />
          <br />
          Occasionally, He performed miracles to drop hints that He was indeed
          far beyond the normal. Repeatedly He demonstrated His ability to
          absorb enormous cruelty and physical punishment without any trace of
          hatred or rancour towards those ill-treating Him. And last but not the
          least, He constantly diverted the attention of one and all from the
          mundane to the Divine.
          <br />
          <br />
          Came finally the day to snap all worldly ties and launch the Mission
          He had incarnated for. October 20, 1940 was that day. On that morning,
          Sathya left for school as usual but within minutes He was back home.
          Standing on the doorstep, He flung aside the bag containing books and
          in ringing tones declared,
          <br />
          <br />
          "I am no longer your Sathya. I am Sai. I don't belong to you. I have
          My work. My devotees are calling Me. I am going. I can no longer stay
          here."
          <br />
          <br />
          Walking up to a neighbour's house, He sat on a rock in the middle of
          the garden there while people flocked, bringing flowers. And then,
          most lovingly and compassionately Sri Sathya Sai Baba led the
          congregation in a bhajan that has now become very familiar to us. He
          sang:
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            Manasa bhajare Gurucharanam,
            <br />
            Dustara bhavasagara tharanam
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            O mind! Meditate on the Lotus Feet of the Lord!
            <br />
            That alone will help you to sail across the turbulent sea called
            life.
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The Avatar had finally revealed Himself. Physically, Sai was still a
          fourteen-year old. Yet, such was His magnetism, and such was the faith
          of the devotees who flocked to Him that they had no reservation in
          accepting Him as a Divine Incarnation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Baba now decided to return to Puttaparthi and make it the base for His
          Mission. The residents of Uravakonda gave Him a ceremonial and tearful
          send-off, and Baba was carried in procession. En route, He was
          joyfully welcomed and worshipped in all the villages that He passed
          through. Back in Puttaparthi He stayed with His parents for a few days
          and then shifted to the house of a pious lady named Subbamma, who
          always had abiding faith in the Divinity of Sathya Sai. Soon,
          Subbamma's unostentatious abode became a pilgrim centre.
          <br />
          <br />
          They came in large numbers to worship Sai, and patiently and
          tirelessly, Subbamma played hostess to them all. The crowds kept
          growing bigger and bigger, and a new residence had to be found for
          Sai. In 1944, Baba moved to a thatched hut in a vacant plot of land
          nearby. The plot was gifted to Swami by Subbamma. Later the hut was
          replaced by a tin shed with verandas on either side - this is the
          famous Paatha Mandiram (Old Mandir) of Puttaparthi folklore.
          <br />
          <br />
          Baba stayed in the shed while devotees occupied the veranda. There was
          a total absence of creature comforts and indeed even elementary
          conveniences that one takes for granted. Yet, for those devotees,
          sharing the same roof with Bhagavan Baba, was veritable heaven.
          <br />
          <br />
          History repeated and Paatha Mandiram also began to overflow - Baba
          clearly needed a much bigger place to receive His devotees. Plans were
          made and in 1950, and what is now known as the Mandir (in Prasanti
          Nilayam), came into existence, in bare-bones form of course.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once Baba moved to Prasanti Nilayam, the tin shed previously occupied
          by Him was replaced by a brick and mortar structure - the Paatha
          Mandiram of yore had now become the Pedda Venkama Raju Kalyana
          Mandapam (marriage hall); to this day, marriages are celebrated in
          this hall.
          <br />
          <br />
          Every Avatar has a Mission. In 1958, Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba
          revealed that His Mission would unfold itself in stages. The first
          sixteen years would be dominated by contact with individuals.
          Following this, attention would be given to groups. In the next phase,
          spiritual exhortation would be the dominant feature, after which
          service to humanity at large would become the principal focus.
          <br />
          <br />
          Baba moves, lives, and acts like ordinary mortals do but His
          extra-ordinary Love (Prema), if noticed, would immediately reveal that
          He is nothing short of Divinity personified.

        <h2>The Avatar on Himself</h2>

        <p>
          An Avatar is an Incarnation of God. In a broad sense, everything in
          the Universe is a manifestation of God. Yet, the term Avatar is
          reserved for those Incarnations wherein the Lord deliberately assumes
          a specific form for a specific purpose.
          <br />
          <br />
          About the meaning of the word Avatar, Swami says,
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            The word Avatar means descent. It is not coming down from the peak
            of a mountain or the top storey of a tall building. It is a descent
            from the state of the Atma to the level of the body.
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          There is nothing infra-dig about the descent, as Bhagavan points out.
          He says,
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            No blemish attaches to the Divine as a result of the descent. There
            is no diminution in Divine power either. Let us say there is a child
            playing on the ground. If the mother feels it is beneath her dignity
            to bend, and tells the child to leap into her arms, the child cannot
            do so.
            <br />
            The mother does not ask the child to do such an impossible thing.
            Instead, full of love, the mother stoops and lovingly picks up the
            child. Likewise, the Lord incarnates assuming a human form to bless
            and rescue those who cannot rise to the level of the Divine.
            Incarnation is an act of benediction.
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          What about the name ‘Sai Baba’ of the present Poorna Avatar? Swami has
          this to say:
          <br />
          <br />
          "The name ‘Sai Baba’ means ‘Divine Mother and Divine Father’. Like a
          mother, I will be tender and soft and give you happiness, and like a
          father, I will punish you when needed. Through these methods I shall
          take you to a high level."
          <br />
          <br />
          Why does God incarnate? No doubt Krishna has already outlined the
          reasons, but Swami goes deeper into the subject. He says,
          <br />
          <br />
          "To elevate man to the level of Supreme Consciousness, God has to
          incarnate as man. God has to speak to man in his own style and
          language. He has to teach mankind the methods that it can adopt and
          practice. Birds and beasts need no Divine incarnation to guide them
          for they have no inclination to stray away from their respective
          duties. Man alone forgets the goal of life."
          <br />
          <br />
          In other words, God comes to play the role of a teacher and a Guru. As
          Swami elaborates,
          <br />
          <br />
          "The essential quality of an Avatar is to teach you to make good and
          proper use of your thought, word and deed. Depending on the conditions
          and the environment in the country, the Avatar will teach and show the
          right use of the Divine faculties gifted to man."
          <br />
          <br />
          In earlier incarnations, the Lord physically annihilated the evil.
          What about this time? Swami has the answer:
          <br />
          <br />
          "In this Kali Age, the wicked have to be reformed and reconstructed
          through Love and Compassion. That is why this Avatar has come unarmed.
          The Avatar has come with the Message of Love."
          <br />
          <br />
          Swami continues:
          <br />
          <br />
          My objective is to establish unity in mankind, to reveal the aspect of
          the Divinity latent in man, and that God must be the only goal in
          life. It is also My duty to make you realize the kind of relationship
          that should exist between fellow human beings.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is something very important, and all of us would do well to
          remember it. The first item on the agenda of this Avatar is to make
          each and every one of us realise our intrinsic Divine nature. Swami
          goes on to add,
          <br />
          <br />
          There is considerable change in human outlook that I have to bring
          about. No one can stop Me or deter Me from fulfilling these tasks for
          which I have come, namely the establishment of the one unchanging
          Truth. In this task, you have a part to play.
          <br />
          <br />
          You must take a path by which you can see deep in My heart, and
          experience the various Divine aspects of Mine. You must understand the
          all-knowing power in Me. Do not be led away by people who always talk
          of having got a locket or a watch or a ring from Me. These things have
          no deep meaning.
          <br />
          <br />
          Swami is Love - in fact, Pure Love. No surprise, since God is Love and
          Love is God. Swami adds that all Incarnations are embodiments of Pure
          Love, as indeed man also is. He says,
          <br />
          <br />
          Divine Love is associated with Immortality. It is to teach mankind the
          truth about this Divine Love that Love itself incarnates on earth in
          human form.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is to drive home the point that we all are sparks of the Divine,
          that Swami invariably begins His Divine Discourses with the words:
          “Embodiments Of Divine Love” Or “Embodiments Of The Divine Atma”.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because the Avatar has a human form, man thinks (mistakenly of course)
          that the Avatar too is just another human being. In this context,
          Swami points out that,
          <br />
          <br />
          When Narayana (Supreme God) takes the form of a man and wants to help
          humanity, He will act like a man. Just because God comes in human
          form, it is no excuse for man to be indifferent. He must realise that
          all the Poorna Avatars are incarnations of the same Formless, Eternal,
          Supreme Consciousness and the Cosmic, Omnipresent, Omnipotent, and
          Omniscient God.
          <br />
          <br />
          Swami conveys this idea in the following manner. He says:
          <br />
          <br />
          Rama, Krishna, and Sai Baba appear different because of the dress
          donned, but it is the selfsame Entity!
          <br />
          <br />
          Playing a role in Swami's global Mission calls for a proper attitude
          and frame of mind. Many people are carried away by Baba's miracles,
          but that is not correct, as Swami warns. He says:
          <br />
          <br />
          It has always happened that many people around the Avatar knew that
          the Avatar was God in human form; yet, they often forgot that fact.
          Why? Swami explains:
          <br />
          <br />
          When the Avatar appears in human form, we find that He exhibits human
          consciousness along with Divine Consciousness. Ordinary people cannot
          grasp the Divine Consciousness of the Avatar.
          <br />
          <br />
          God appears to be an ordinary human being to the limited intelligence
          of lay people because of the co-existence of the Divine and the human
          aspects of the Consciousness exhibited by Him. Man's perception is
          limited to the level of human consciousness.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, human comprehension is restricted by the limits of human
          consciousness. But the sages of yore were able to cognise the Formless
          God in the visible Form because they had imbued themselves with Divine
          Consciousness. Thus, according to their levels, different people
          regard an Avatar as a mere human being or the Cosmic Reality.
          <br />
          <br />
          All the above are quotes of Swami's pronouncements about Avatars in
          general. Let us now look at what Swami has said about the current
          Sathya Sai Avatar. He once observed:
          <br />
          <br />
          Because I am like an ordinary individual when I am talking with you
          and playing with you, many people do not understand My true nature.
          Even people with great strength of mind cannot recognize the true
          nature of Sai, and the difference between the external appearance and
          the internal aspect. Sai knows everything. That people are in doubt is
          due to the maya (illusion) of the Avatar.
          <br />
          <br />
          There is no use telling people who refuse to know. For people who
          know, there is no need to tell. But for people who know and yet do not
          know, it becomes necessary to present what I call My ‘visiting card’.
          Therefore, if today I have chosen to tell you about Myself, it is with
          a view to present you with My visiting card. In the whole of our
          spiritual history, we find that only Krishna had proclaimed His
          Divinity in this manner.
          <br />
          <br />
          Miracles, no doubt, have a powerful effect on all those who witness
          them. Since miracles are considered super-natural, miracles alone are
          regarded as a sign of Divinity. Swami emphatically declares that
          miracles alone are not the signature of Divinity. He says in this
          context,
          <br />
          <br />
          To talk of the Vibhuti that I give or to talk of the things that I
          materialize and the miracles I perform is not correct. Sometimes, I
          feel like laughing at the ignorance of people when they attach such
          importance to My miracles. People talk only of such things and forget
          the much bigger aspect in Me.
          <br />
          <br />
          The most sacred quality in Me is Prema (Love). This Prema is
          immeasurable!
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Love, Love and Love. I am always Love! Love is everything but
          people do not understand Love!
          <br />
          <br />
          Yes, God is Love and Love is God. Thus, Love is the true form of God,
          and it would benefit us to always see Bhagavan Baba as nothing but the
          embodiment of Purest Love.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lets us get back to the aspect of maya confusing the devotees. Warning
          devotees not to be deluded by His finite form, Baba cautions,
          <br />
          <br />
          Since you see me in close proximity, you are not able to assess Me
          properly. Familiarity has deceived you to the point of delusion.
          Swami's form is Big, Vast and Infinite!
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the reasons why all of us fall into the trap of maya is that
          most of the time, Swami acts just like an ordinary human being - there
          are no miracles. People then tend to forget the Infinite Divine Power
          latent in Him. About this, Swami says,
          <br />
          <br />
          The attributes and the power of the Avatar remain unaltered in their
          pristine amplitude. The Divine manifests His powers according to the
          needs, the circumstances, and the conditions prevailing at a
          particular time or place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Take, for example, the case of a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
          He has the power to both, protect or punish. These powers can be
          exercised only when he is sitting in the judicial chair. The same
          Chief Justice, when he is at home, confers joy on his grandson by
          letting him ride on his back. By allowing the grandchild to play in
          this manner, does the Chief Justice forfeit his judicial powers?
          Similarly, the Avatar does not forgo any of His Supreme Powers merely
          because He lives and moves amongst human beings as a man.
          <br />
          <br />
          An Avatar is capable of all things at all times. Yet, the Avatar will
          not undertake to demonstrate His powers all the time. The Avatar will
          exercise such powers only when exceptional circumstances demand it,
          and will shed Grace on a deserving person alone.
          <br />
          <br />
          There is no limitation to My Power. There is no reason to limit or
          confine My Power and My Grace to any one place. Infinite Power and
          Infinite Grace are present in My hands. To state these things with
          regard to Myself becomes necessary at times. People are sometimes
          confused. Why are there at times, setbacks in the life of an Avatar?
          Actually, there are never any setbacks. There cannot be. What seems to
          us as a set back is all a part of the Divine Drama.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sometimes we may understand the mystery but most of the time we do
          not. About this business of so-called apparent impediments to the
          Mission of the Avatar, Swami has this to say:
          <br />
          <br />
          In an Avatar, there never will be a situation in which you can find
          fault with Him. The individual who accuses an Avatar will be hurting
          himself in his eye with his own finger.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here is a quote from a remarkable discourse given by Bhagavan during
          the Summer Course in 1974. This Discourse appears as Chapter 16 of
          Part II of the Proceedings and is entitled: WHO IS SAI BABA? In this,
          Bhagavan says:
          <br />
          <br />
          Inherent beauty and attractiveness are obvious in His playing and in
          His singing. These are the aspects of Shiva Shakti that is immanent in
          Him. How is it possible for anyone to understand Sathya Sai merely
          from His external Form?
          <br />
          <br />
          One very important characteristic of an Avatar is that He is totally
          selfless. Divinity knows no selfishness. God is ever compassionate,
          ever ready to sacrifice, and is totally free from desires. As Baba
          puts it,
          <br />
          <br />
          There is no desire in Sai. Where is the space for desire in Sai?
          Everything is already Mine! Sai does not think. My will is instantly
          realized. Whatever it may be, it immediately appears.
          <br />
          <br />
          To put it all simply, no one can understand the Avatar and His
          actions. As Baba once declared,
          <br />
          <br />
          If Balarama (the brother of Krishna) himself could not understand Me,
          how can you?!
          <br />
          <br />
          Indeed. So it is a futile exercise to try to understand Bhagavan and
          analyse His actions. Instead, one must concentrate on His teachings,
          absorb them, and follow them. We must appreciate that God has come on
          earth as man for an exalted purpose. We must not, even if it be
          unknowingly, trivialise the Divine Mission by asking Swami for
          trinkets. Swami of course does not mind. He gives us all that we ask
          for, even if they are useless. Why does He do so? Swami Himself has
          given the answer. He says,
          <br />
          <br />
          I readily give you what you want, so that one day you may want what I
          have come to give you.
          <br />
          <br />
          And what is it that He is so eager to give us? The very same thing
          that He gave to Arjuna five thousand and odd years ago on the battle
          field - the Knowledge of the Universal Self or Atmavidya. That is what
          the Avatar has come to give us and that really is what we must seek
          earnestly from Him. And once we have that, our lives too, just like
          the Avatar’s, will transform into a saga of perennial bliss
